# RMNet: Equivalently Removing Residual Connection from Networks

This repository is the unofficial implementation of  ["RMNet: Equivalently Removing Residual Connection from Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00687). Official code is [here](https://github.com/fxmeng/RMNet).

### train and test
run this command to train and test the code(contain channel prune method):

```buildoutcfg
python train_and_test_CIFAR.py
```
this repo is a toy implementation, so the acc may be not equal to normal model.(when the RMnet be pruned)
